# Framework16-NixOS
My NixOS Config for my Framework 16 Laptop

Wanted to keep it super simple and only have the packages installed for a pretty basic system.  All hardware is working with this setup and with flatpak running more apps can be added easily through the software center or by editing this config for native style programs instead of flatpaks.
